# Controls #

  * Use **mouse pointer** to control elevator. Vertical pointer position within game window corresponds to control stick position in real plane.
  * Use **mouse wheel** to control throttle.
  * **V**/**F** - open/close flaps.
  * **SPACE** - turn or flip plane. Plane will turn when standing on the ground, and flip when flying with speed above 120 km/h.
  * **Page Up**/**Page Down** - zoom in/zoom out.
  * **B** - apply wheel brake.
  * **A** - toggle autopilot.
  * **Left Mouse Button** - fire gun.

# How to fly #

Currently there is only one plane available. It's small, slow, STOL recon plane, and it's relatively easy to fly.

## Start ##

Throttle engine to max, get some speed and off you go!

## Flying ##

Flying is pretty easy. Use minimap to navigate. To turn around, get at least 150-200 m above ground, speed up to at least 150 km/h, then flip plane (SPACE) and use half-loop to change direction.

## Landing ##

Use yellow spotlight as a guide, fly along the light beam. Deploy full flaps (V), and reduce throttle to 20-30%. Maintain speed 80-90 km/h during approach.

Just above runway recover from dive, gently point the nose up, and try to touch down with minimal vertical speed. Do not turn the engine off, small thrust will help you recover from bounce.

To repair and re-arm plane taxi to hangar and stop. Plane will be fixed within few seconds.
